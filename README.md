HKS project about disbursement of funds to schools in countries for internet connectivity

Methodology:
The dataset has been sourced from ProjectConnect's website, collected by our team member Kay Val. 
Further, this dataset has been transformed using excel -- to develop ranks and points. The latter has further been subdivided into a need based and a performance based ranking -- the calculations have been shown in the updated dataset with calculations. 

The top 9 countries were identified as having less than 50 percent of their schools connected to the Internet. These countries were simply ranked based on the percentage of unconnected schools, with the country with the highest percentage of unconnected schools getting a rank of 1. 

The other two metrics, infrastructure and need have been normalized from 1-9 based on ranks given by the ICT Development Index and Corruption Perceptions Index. 

However, there was also the problem of missing data for three countries - Niger, South Sudan and Sierra Leone. 

Methodology for calculating the rank for missing countries:

ITUâ€™s 2017 ICT index does not account for Sierra Leone, South Sudan and Niger. For calculating the missing index the indicators and sub-indices for each country were put together and the scores were calculated according to the ICT methodology given below. We took data from the nearest available year for certain parameters for which the data from 2017 is not available.

The scores indicate how 3 the countries fare relative to each other. We infer that Sierra Leone is better performing than Niger, which in turn performs better that South Sudan.

For the ranking these countries among the other 6 countries, we took the help of field experts to understand their relative  status in comparison with the rest of the countries. We were informed that Sierra Leone is least developed among Hondura, El Salvador, Zimbabwe, Philippines and Colombia. Thereafter we placed Sierra Leon, South Sudan and Niger  after Colombia, Philippines, El Salvador, Honduras, Zimbabwe, Sierra Leone, Niger and South Sudan.

 We placed Sudan after South Sudan because while South Sudan shows 99.53percent internet connectivity in schools, Sudan shows no internet. This data helped us compare between the two recently separated regions.

Based on this conceptual framework, the IDI is divided into the following three sub-indices, and a total of 11 indicators (Figure 1).
		Access sub-index: This sub-index captures ICT readiness, and includes five infrastructure and access indicators (fixed-telephone subscriptions, mobile-cellular telephone subscriptions, international Internet bandwidth per Internet user, households with a computer, and households with Internet access).
		Use sub-index: This sub-index captures ICT intensity, and includes three intensity and usage indicators (individuals using the Internet, fixed broadband subscriptions, and mobile-broadband subscriptions).
		Skills sub-index: This sub-index seeks to capture capabilities or skills which are important for ICTs. It includes three proxy indicators (mean years of schooling, gross secondary enrolment, and gross tertiary enrolment). As these are proxy indicators, rather than indicators directly measuring ICT-related skills, the skills sub-index is given less weight in the computation of the IDI than the other two sub-indices.

Calculating the IDI
Sub-indices were computed by summing the weighted values of the indicators included in the respective subgroup.
		ICT access is measured by fixed-telephone subscriptions per 100 inhabitants, mobile-cellular subscriptions per 100 inhabitants, international Internet bandwidth per Internet user, the percentage of households with a computer and the percentage of households with Internet access.
		ICT usage is measured by the percentage of individuals using the Internet, fixed-broadband Internet subscriptions per 100 inhabitants and active mobile-broadband subscriptions per 100 inhabitants.
		ICT skills are approximated by mean years of schooling, secondary gross enrolment ratio and tertiary gross enrolment ratio.
The values of the sub-indices were calculated first by normalizing the indicators included in each sub-index in order to obtain the same unit of measurement. The reference values applied in the normalization process were discussed above. The sub-index value was calculated by taking the simple average (using equal weighting) of the normalized indicator values.

For computation of the final Index, the ICT access and ICT usage sub-indices were each given a 40 per cent weighting, and the skills sub-index (because it is based on proxy indicators) a 20 per cent weighting. The final Index value was then computed by summation of the weighted sub-indices.
